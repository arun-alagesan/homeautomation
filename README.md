Developement process :

1. Always checkout a new branch from dev for any improvement or feature work and avoid direct commits to dev as much as possible

2. Create a Pull request to dev branch from the feature branch

3. CI build will kick in and wait for it to complete. Fix any error or build failure 

4. Review and merge the pull request

5. CD job will kick in to build the push the dist folder to demo repo /my-home-vue-ui
